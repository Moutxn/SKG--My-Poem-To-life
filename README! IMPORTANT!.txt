 > "Super Kaizo Galaxy - My Poem To Life" is what we can call a 'Green Star mod', as every Power Star is now in different locations to act like the Green Stars in SMG2.
  * Additional Power Stars were also added. Every Galaxy has now at least 2 Stars.
  * Even if you can receive mail from Toad about Luigi Power Stars, they are now simple secrets: you do not need to ever find Luigi.

 > This mod is 2P + Luigi only. Playing with 2P is required.

 > The number of Stars required for every Galaxy is changed, with the exception of Good Egg and any Hungry Luma Galaxy.

 > This mod is English-only. Almost every NPC has changed text (and some new NPCs are added, even if few). This mod is also part of the Eclipse lore.

 > Even if there is a Counter for Comet Medals, NO COMET MEDALS ARE IN THIS MOD! Not one. No need to try to find them.

 > Lastly, you can SKIP the in-build cutscenes by pressing A (going to Galaxy Reactor + the two cutscenes there). They are not cannon, but removing them might pose an issue: please,
  just skip them by pressing/spamming A.




 /!\ IMPORTANT!!!!!!! /!\


 > FOR ANY "MAIN GALAXY" (so not any Galaxy that normally has 1 or 2 Stars), PLEASE *ALWAYS* TAKE A SECRET STAR BEFORE DOING THE THREE MAIN STARS!!
  The issue is that the game HATES having 3 Secret Stars not collected at once, making the Galaxy soft-lock itself.
  If you did the two first normal Stars and you have yet to grab a Secret Star, go back to Star 1 or 2 and grab a Secret. Not all main Galaxies are 8 Stars (some are 7 Stars), but
 even then, do not take any risk.
  *I WILL NOT PROVIDE YOU A SAVE FILE IF THIS HAPPENS.

 > DO NOT ENTER ANY GALAXY THAT HAS 8 STARS COMPLETED!!!!!!!
  If you are done with a Galaxy that has 8 Stars, do NOT go back to it, as it will crash your mod/game. Simply leaving the mod and going back to it will be enough, but you will never
 be able to join that Galaxy again.
  For example, if you are done with Good Egg, and you have all 8 Stars completed, do NOT enter Good Egg ever again - this is the case for any 8 Stars Galaxies.

 > It might be possible that some Purple Coins Comets do not appear/spawn for you (it shouldn't happen, but still is a possibility).
  If this happen to you and that you are unable to collect all Stars, please, use the Save File present in the Folder called "Save File For Last Galaxy".
  You won't be able to play the levels that were not showing, as it will crash your game (see the warning on top of this), but because it's Purple Coins, who care anyway...?





 ABOUT GALAXIES!!!

 > If some Galaxies don't unlock despite you having the right number of stars, it might mean that same Galaxy has a "condition" to be unlocked. A good example is "Bonefin", which
 requires Drip Drop 1 to be beaten so you can unlock it; but to unlock Drip Drop, you need to have beat Beach Bowl 1. Few Galaxies act like that, but don't think the mod broke if it
 happens!
